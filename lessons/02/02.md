Data are collected from sensors, sensor networks, remote sensing, observations, and more. This calls for increased attention to data management and stewardship.

The amount of available storage is not keeping up with the amount of data flooding in daily. How do we decide what data we keep?

### perchè gestire i dati

Most researchers have spent time, at some point in their careers, digging through their computer to find a specific file that can’t be located. It’s incredibly frustrating and a waste of time and resources, especially if you end up recollecting missing data. The good news is that it is possible to avoid this situation entirely by strategically managing your data better.

Done well, research data management means:

    always understanding what your data is and how you collected it even if the data is a year old
    always finding the file you need quickly
    never losing your data even if your hard drive crashes
    knowing what rights and responsibilities you have over your data
    knowing how and where to share your data to comply with your funder’s data sharing policy
    being able to pick up and easily reuse data from a past project


Begins with your initial considerations regarding what will be necessary for using or collecting your particular type of data;
    Includes measures for maintaining the integrity of the data, making sure that they are not lost due to technical mishaps, and that the right people can access the data at the appropriate time;
    Looks forward to the future, making it clear that you should provide detailed and structured documentation to be able to share your data with other colleagues and prepare them for long-term availability.

### Perché gestire i dati: prospettiva di chi fa ricerca

Successfully managing your data throughout a research project helps ensures its preservation for future use. It also facilitates collaboration within your team, and it helps advance your scientific outcomes.

Manage your data for yourself:

    Organize your files (data inputs, analytic scripts, outputs) at various stages of the analytic process
    Track your science processes for reproducibility – match your outputs with exact inputs and transformations that produced them
    Better control versions of data – identify easily versions that can be periodically purged
    Quality control your data more efficiently

    Make backups to avoid data loss
    Format your data for re-use (by yourself or others)
    Be prepared: Document your data for your own recollection, accountability, and re-use (by yourself or others)
    Prepare it to share it – gain credibility and recognition for your science efforts!

### Perché gestire i dati: prospettiva istituzionale



    Data are a valuable asset – expensive and time consuming to collect

Data should be managed to:

    Maximize the effective use and value of data & information assets
    Continually improve quality including: accuracy, integrity, integration, timeliness of capture, presentation, relevance & usefulness
    Ensure appropriate use of data and information
    Facilitate data sharing
    Ensure sustainability and accessibility in long term for re-use in science

### Perché i dati ben gestiti sono importanti

Here are a few reasons (from the UK Data Archive):

    Increases the impact and visibility of research
    Promotes innovation and potential new data uses
    Leads to new collaborations between data users and creators
    Maximizes transparency and accountability


    Enables scrutiny of research findings
    Encourages improvement and validation of research methods
    Reduces cost of duplicating data collection
    Provides important resources for education and training

### Come gestiamo i dati?

A research data lifecycle illustrates stages through which well-managed data passes from the inception of a research project to its conclusion.

### La gestione dei dati 

data management is a set of collective practices and decisions that make it easier for you, your collaborators, and your future self to find, understand, and use your research data. These practices cover the entire lifecycle of research data, from its collection and analysis through sharing and reuse. There is no one magical data management practice to rule them all. Rather, data management consists of a number of small activities that make dealing with your data a better experience.

La gestione dei dati è il processo di organizzazione critica dei dati durante il loro ciclo di vita.

An awareness of data curation can help researchers make decisions from the conception and creation of data which can then improve use and potential re-use of that data for the longer term

### Pianificazione

Map out the processes and resources for all activities related to the handling of the project’s data assets. 

Start with the project goals (desired outputs, outcomes, and impacts) and work backwards to build a data management plan, supporting data policies, and sustainability plans for each step.

### Raccolta, processamento, analisi

Activities needed to collect new or existing data. 

Every step needed to prepare new or existing data to be able to use it as an input for synthesis.  Data from multiple sources are combined into a form that can be readily analyzed.

Create analyses and visualizations to identify patterns, test hypotheses, and illustrate findings.

### Conservazione e Pubblicazione

Plan on how you are going to store your data for long-term use and accessibility so others can access, interpret, and use the data in the future. Decide what data to preserve, where to preserve it, and what documentation needs to accompany the data.

Publication and distribution of your data through the web or in data catalogs, social media or other venues to increase the chances of your data being discovered.

---

### Nel frattempo: Documentazione

Document data and each of the data stages by describing the why, who, what, when, where, and how of the data and processes through documentation and metadata.

Employ quality assurance and quality control procedures that enhance the quality of data.

Plan to preserve data in the short term to minimize potential losses (e.g., via software failure, human error, natural disaster).

### Sessione pratica: Introduzione a Python con Google Colab

Data Carpentry’s teaching is hands-on, so participants are encouraged to use their own computers to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow.
These lessons assume no prior knowledge of the skills or tools.

This lesson requires a working copy of Python.
